To those who tried to visit this site only to get a 404 error in the
last 24 hours, I apologize. I believe DNS propagation was the culprit,
and I jumped the gun by announcing that my post was up. I was able to
view stephentudor.com just fine, but quickly found that several people,
including my lovely wife, could not even get to the site initially.

By this time, it appears that most folks have been able to access it. If
you can see this post, you're fine. Otherwise, you're probably in the
camp that is left wondering why [this joker posted a 404 URL to
Twitter](//twitter.com/tudorstudio/status/89876273408655360).

Again, mea culpa. I'll know better next time :)
